# Pedestrian-and-Vehicle-Detection-Using-Haar-Cascade-Classifier

Vehicle detection and tracking applications play an important role for civilian and military applications such as in highway traffic surveillance control, management and urban traffic planning.

This is a very basic project where we have performed the detection of pedestrian and vehicles seperately, using the Haar Cascade Classifier. 

You are more than welcome to implement the model. 
You can try importing a dataset which includes both the pedestrians on the foot path and the vehicles on the road, for detecting the safety of pedestrians walking by, and imlplement it accordingly!
